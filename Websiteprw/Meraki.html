      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>I'm Anaogha Lakshmi, someone who strives to carve a unique path for myself and inspire others to do the same. My diverse upbringing has given me a sense of belonging in many places, and growing up in culturally rich environments has helped me become adaptable and open-minded.
        <br><br>
        While living in India, where reusing and recycling are commonplace, I've noticed that, people value product comfort and durability but often have to rely on make-shift solutions when they encounter issues. This realization sparked my passion for product design. Imagine a world where people no longer need alternative solutions to their problems because they have a comfortable and reliable product at hand, A world where there is no stress for using a product.</p>
